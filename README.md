Welcome to our Quadcopter Project, a sophisticated integration of advanced hardware and software designed for high-performance autonomous flight. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the components and features that make this project unique, offering insight into its capabilities, design choices, and operational flexibility.

Hardware Components Overview
S500 Frame
Description: The S500 is our chosen frame due to its robustness and stability. It provides a reliable foundation for mounting all other quadcopter components, including motors, ESCs, and the flight controller, ensuring a balanced and stable flight.

Sunnysky 960kv BLDC Motors
Description: Four Sunnysky 960kv Brushless DC motors power our quadcopter. These motors are selected for their high efficiency, reliability, and superior torque, providing the necessary lift and responsiveness for various flight operations.

30 Amps ESCs
Description: Each motor is connected to a 30-amp Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). These ESCs are crucial for the precise control of motor speed, contributing to the smooth and stable flight characteristics of our quadcopter.

Glass Fiber 9450 Self-locking Propellers
Description: We use glass fiber 9450 self-locking propellers for optimal thrust and efficiency. These propellers are designed to lock securely onto the motors, reducing the risk of detachment during flight and providing a reliable lift mechanism.

Pixhawk Flight Controller with GPS and Compass
Description: The quadcopter's operations are managed by a Pixhawk flight controller, an advanced system equipped with GPS and compass modules. This controller enables a wide range of autonomous functions and flight modes, from basic stabilization to complex navigational tasks.

Power System
Battery Specifications
Standard Battery: 4S 5200mAh LiPo battery.
