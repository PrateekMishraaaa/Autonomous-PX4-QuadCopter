Propellers: Our quadcopter uses glass fiber 9450 self-locking propellers. These propellers offer a great balance between thrust and efficiency, ensuring our quadcopter has the lift and agility needed for a variety of tasks.

Flight Controller: The Pixhawk flight controller, equipped with GPS and compass modules, serves as the brain of our quadcopter. This advanced flight controller enables a wide range of flight modes and features, ensuring our quadcopter can handle complex autonomous operations.

Power System
Battery: Initially, the quadcopter is powered by a 4S 5200mAh LiPo battery, which provides an endurance of 15-20 minutes. For extended missions, there's an option to use a larger 8000mAh 4S LiPo battery, further increasing the flight time and allowing for longer, uninterrupted operations.

Software Components
PX4 Stable Pro Firmware: The quadcopter runs on the PX4 Stable Pro firmware. This open-source flight control software is at the forefront of drone technology, offering robust features for autonomous flight and navigation.

Q Ground Control Software: Programming and mission planning are conducted through the Q Ground Control software. This intuitive software provides a user-friendly interface for configuring the quadcopter, planning missions, and monitoring live telemetry data.

Capabilities
The integration of advanced hardware with sophisticated software allows our quadcopter to perform a wide range of autonomous operations:

Waypoint Navigation: Users can define specific flight paths and waypoints for the quadcopter to follow, enabling precise aerial surveys and inspections.

Mapping and Surveying: With the ability to carry various cameras and sensors, the quadcopter can be used for detailed aerial mapping and surveying tasks.

Return To Launch (RTL): In the event of a lost signal or low battery, the quadcopter is capable of automatically returning to its launch point, ensuring the safety of both the quadcopter and its surroundings.

Variable Camera Angles: The flexible mounting options and flight stability allow for capturing high-quality aerial footage from various angles, suitable for filmmaking, real estate photography, and more.

Extended Endurance: The standard flight time ranges from 15-20 minutes, but with the capability to upgrade to an 8000mAh battery, operators can enjoy extended mission times, making it ideal for more demanding applications.

This Quadcopter project represents a leap forward in drone technology, combining state-of-the-art hardware and software to create a versatile and reliable aerial vehicle. Whether you're a hobbyist looking to explore the skies or a professional requiring detailed aerial data, this quadcopter is designed to meet a wide range of needs.
